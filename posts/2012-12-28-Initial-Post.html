      <div id="post"><p>I have false-started a blog too many times to count, and it&#39;s because
        I kept trying to write about things that I don&#39;t really want to talk
        about that much. So this blog is dedicated to the two things that I
        <em>do</em> want to share: home improvement and software development.</p>
        
        <p>I&#39;m starting off with no styling except that provided by my syntax
        highlighter (I&#39;m using kramdown+coderay, since I saw an example that
        made it look straightforward), and it will probably only be hosted by
        github for some long while.. But I&#39;m sure I will grow an enormous
        readership based solely on the resonating quality of my thoughts.
        That&#39;s how this works, right?</p>
        
        <p>I&#39;m going to end this first post with a list of things I intend to
        write about, primarily to make getting into this thing easier for
        myself, but also in case you are curious what we&#39;ll be getting into.</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Building a butcher-block (kind of) countertop the cheap and easy way</li>
        <li>Decorators (the pattern, not the draper gem), for slimmer models</li>
        <li>Presenters (using the draper gem), for uncluttering the rails helper namespace</li>
        <li>An open kitchen, or &quot;My hatred for cabinetry&quot;</li>
        <li>Managing serious data manipulation in Rails. Despite Rails? <em>Near</em> Rails.
        (This is probably a 2-4 post series, there&#39;s a lot to chat about)</li>
        <li>Building my standing desk</li>
        <li>Financial Independence (I won&#39;t talk long on this, no nagging)</li>
        </ul>
