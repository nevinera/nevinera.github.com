* title: Butcherblock Countertops
* subtitle: How to slam down a slab of wood and call it "Home Improvement"

My wife has written about our countertops previously, at
[her blog](rusticmodern.blogspot.com) - I'll be stealing most of my photographs
from there, since she is a professional photographer and I don't own a camera.

My general philosophy of home improvement stems from my history in software
development: improvements should be modular, reversible, and should have lots
of room for error built into their designs. To that end, my "kitchen renovation"
(which most would do as a monolithic project involving contractors from multiple
businesses) was divided up into a dozen separate one-weekend tasks, any of which
could be left indefinitely (all of the intermediate states had to be functional,
because I have to commit everything to `master` as I go).

### Standing Counter

I'll start with an image of my first countertop project - this corner used to
contain a small red table.

![Standing Countertop](/images/kitchen/standing-counter.jpg)

The materials involved:

* Pine 2x4, about 6'
* 3-4 small L-brackets
* 1.5" steel pipe, plus one flange
* Two Ikea cutting boards
* One plank of Ikea Numerar (red oak) butcherblock
* Quite a lot of cheap mineral oil

This project actually also had two pieces - the main countertop, made of oak,
and the windowsill, made of.. probably poplar, but they're just cutting boards.
The oak plank got some sanding, but I don't have an electric sander - I just
spent about 30 minutes rubbing it down, focused largely on the front edge (where
people will be leaning).

The 2x4 is angle-cut with a plastic mitre box, because the end poking out seems
more attractive that way. I mounted the outside ends of the table onto the wall
(at studs, if you don't have a stud-finder, you *need to buy one*) at roughly the
right height, and snugged the actual countertop into the corner to level them with.

The pipe flange is attached to the front corner of the counter with some one-inch
screws, and the 2x4s are attached to the back edge of the counter with L-brackets
(I always seem to have some of these lying around somewhere). Then, with the front
corner of the counter propped up on a table with a few books, I measured out the
appropriate length of pipe, and had Home Depot cut me some to fit. I picked up
a rubber foot for the end while I was there, but I forgot to account for the extra
height - my counter is currently only separated from the linoleum by some doubled
cloth (until I get to the floor replacement..) I screwed the new-cut pipe into
its flange, and the counter was built!

It took about a dozen cycles of coating it with oil, and then wiping it clean
before I was satisfied with its water-resistance, but it's held up well for
more than a year now, and I use it as a cutting-board constantly.

The surprisingly tricky part was actually the window-sill. I had originally planned
to make it of the same stuff, but two-inch-thick red oak turns out to be too
tough for cheap table saws to handle, and there's no way I'm going to do that
much notch-cutting with a handsaw! You can't see the other side from here, but
the ends of the sill jut well past the edge of the actual window on both sides,
so I had to fit a 3-4 inch notch into each end. There's a seam running across
the middle of it, where my two cutting boards matched - this fitting was mostly
a matter of shaving plaster and wood until my boards both fit just barely into
the hole, and then gluing them in place. They aren't glued to the oak countertop
though - I can still remove that by taking out a few screws and sliding it away
(and I'll need to when I get to that floor!)

### Sink-adjacent Counter

This corner used to be your standard cheap white laminate countertop, with a
drop-sink. It was functional, but the corner join on the other side of the sink
wasn't lining up any longer, and they were 30+ years old and showing it.

We had hoped for a farmhouse sink, but months of watching craigslist didn't pan
out, and the Ikea porcelain ones don't appear to hold up well - the display model
was beat all to hell, and there wasn't anyone washing dishes in that one at all.

This one, the Numerar, caught our eye while we were looking - we were initially
skeptical, because it's *really* deep - a good 6 inches lower than most sinks at
the bottom. That has turned out to be fairly pleasant, because we also got a
faucet that sprays with some impressive water pressure (washing spoons can drench
you), and the extra distance keeps us dry! The main bonus though, is that it
happens to be exactly the dimensions of the red oak butcher block planks, which
are *also* called 'Numerar'. Because of that, I don't have to find a way to cut
a curved hole into a 2" thick oak slab, and I am *thankful*.

By replacing the sink at the same time as the counter, I in fact was able to
position it exactly one plank's distance from the edge of the room, which allowed
me to slot a slab into place *withoout cutting* it. The thing is so heavy that I
didn't even screw it into place - it's just sanded, oiled, and sitting there.

The thing that had us initially concerned was that everyone on the internet
*insists* that putting wood next to a sink is a terrible *terrible* idea. I
decided (as I often do) to just ignore them - their concerns proved reasonable,
but it doesn't turn out to matter. After about 8 months of usage with water spraying
on it, chopping on it, etc, we have some signs of wear, including a number of blackish
rings from leaving wet jars sitting there for days - but overall, it's just gotten
a nice *old* feel to it, and it looks great! The most important thing here though is that
I paid $90 for it, and spent maybe an hour installing it. If I had to replace it
*every 6 months* it would still work out to a better deal than any of the other
options (I think every 3-5 years is more likely, and even that's only because I
have plenty of other uses for the slab once the kitchen is done with it).

Here's a closer look at the edge with the sink - this is a few months after
installation, and you can see a slightly darker color on the end. It comes off
with mild sanding, but so far I haven't bothered.

To the left you can see what I consider inconvenience 'within acceptable
parameters' - This two-inch wide hole (from where the old sink used to sit)
existed for about three months before I got around to building the corner
countertop out of tile. More about that another day.

The sink and faucet cost me about *three times* what the counter cost, but those
aren't things I've figured out how to do myself, yet. My first concrete sink will
be in a less central location, like the master bathroom, and I'll be sure to tell
you all about it.
