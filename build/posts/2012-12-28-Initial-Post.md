* title: Getting Started
* subtitle: My Last First Post

I have false-started a blog too many times to count, and it's because
I kept trying to write about things that I don't really want to talk
about that much. So this blog is dedicated to the two things that I
*do* want to share: home improvement and software development.

I'm starting off with no styling except that provided by my syntax
highlighter (I'm using kramdown+coderay, since I saw an example that
made it look straightforward), and it will probably only be hosted by
github for some long while.. But I'm sure I will grow an enormous
readership based solely on the resonating quality of my thoughts.
That's how this works, right?

I'm going to end this first post with a list of things I intend to
write about, primarily to make getting into this thing easier for
myself, but also in case you are curious what we'll be getting into.

* Building a butcher-block (kind of) countertop the cheap and easy way
* Decorators (the pattern, not the draper gem), for slimmer models
* Presenters (using the draper gem), for uncluttering the rails helper namespace
* An open kitchen, or "My hatred for cabinetry"
* Managing serious data manipulation in Rails. Despite Rails? *Near* Rails.
  (This is probably a 2-4 post series, there's a lot to chat about)
* Building my standing desk
* Financial Independence (I won't talk long on this, no nagging)
